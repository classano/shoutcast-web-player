# shoutcast web player 

The main reason of this project is to make own HTML5/jQuery/CSS3 audio player that plays a Shoutcast stream, gets the song name and listeners count.

I'm still working on this project. Nothing is complete but you can feel free to contribute if you want to.

1. Clone repo
2. cmd -> bower install
3. Go go go!
